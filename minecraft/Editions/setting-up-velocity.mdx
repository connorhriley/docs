Velocity is a high-performance and modern proxy created by the team behind the Paper Spigot fork. It's a growing solution that replaces Waterfall and even the industry-standard Bungeecord.

## Downloading Velocity

When downloading velocity you will need to navigate to the PaperMC website [here](https://papermc.io/downloads#Velocity) and download the latest version. 

Velocity is not a plugin and requires it's own server to run. You can't use your main server and just upload the `.jar`. 

## Installing Velocity

### Resource Requirements

Velocity requires a minimum of 512MB of RAM although we strongly recommend at least 1GB for a smooth experience. You can then allocate 1-5GB of storage. 

### Using our server slicing features

If you own a Cirus Seed or Citrus Fruit plan you will have access to our exclusive server slicing feature. This allows you to "slice" your plans resources into multiple servers rather than purchasing multiple. 

1. Navigate to the **Slice** tab within the control panel.
2. Create a split with the recommended resources listed above and choose Velocity. 
3. Then split your server and you will be able to navigate to it as a normal server.

### I can't split a server

If you own a Citrus Shared, Citrus Slice (VM) server or are using a different provider then you will need to purchase an additional plan with the minimum recommended resources and then you can proceed.
