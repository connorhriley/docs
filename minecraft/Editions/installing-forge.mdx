title: 'Installing Forge'
description: 'Forge is a powerful modloader that is used by a large majority of modpacks as of writing and can be installed onto our servers one of two ways.'

Some modpacks will download Forge by default when using CurseForge, however in the case that yours does not you can download Forge directly from our Control Panel. 

## Using our Version Tool

1. Login to the panel
2. Navigate to the **Versions** tab on the left.
3. At the top it will show your current version, if you are not using Forge then click the dropdown
4. Select Forge then choose the appropriate version and click install. 

<Warning>Whenever changing versions remember to take appropriate backups. The following directories will be deleted; server.jar, libraries, mods, resources, scripts, fontfiles and resources.</Warning>

Our Versions tab is a large library of different editions however if the one you require isn't shown such as the very latest version, you can follow the steps below to upload Fabric manually.
