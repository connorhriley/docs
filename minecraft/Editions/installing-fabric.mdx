Some modpacks will download Fabric by default when using CurseForge, however in the case that yours does not you can download Forge directly from our Control Panel. 

## Using our Version tool

1. Login to the panel
2. Navigate to the **Versions** tab on the left.
3. At the top it will show your current version, if you are not using Fabric then click the dropdown
4. Select Fabric then choose the appropriate version and click install. 

<Warning>Whenever changing versions remember to take appropriate backups. The following directories will be deleted; server.jar, libraries, mods, resources, scripts, fontfiles and resources.</Warning>

Our Versions tab is a large library of different editions however if the one you require isn't shown such as the very latest version, you can follow the steps below to upload Fabric manually.

## Manually installing Fabric

If you find yourself in the situation of requiring the installation of a Fabric version not available in our Version Installer, the manual installation of Fabric from Fabric's Server Launcher becomes necessary.

Fabric provides a singular jar installer/server launcher that handles both the installation and operation of the server for all game versions and Mod Loaders.

Initiate the process by visiting the Minecraft Server Launcher page on the Fabric website. From there, carefully choose the Minecraft Version, Fabric Loader Version, and Installer Version. It's essential to note that these selections can be mixed independently, so verify their accuracy!

Once you've made the appropriate version selections, proceed to download the executable jar. Subsequently, upload the downloaded file to your server. Upon completion of the file upload, modify the Startup Parameter Server Jar File to match the name of the recently uploaded jar file, and then commence the server. After a brief moment, during the server startup, you'll be prompted to accept Mojang's EULA. Once accepted, you can proceed to start the server as usual.
