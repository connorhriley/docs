## Basic Administration

In Vanilla Minecraft, there are a set of fundamental administrative commands available for managing player access to your server. These commands can serve as warning systems or enable you to remove problematic players from your community. To execute these commands, you will need to provide the username of the player in the designated space. The first command, "`/kick`", allows you to kick a player out of the server. This will immediately remove them from the game. The second command, "`/ban`", enables you to ban a player from the server. Once banned, they will be unable to join unless you choose to un-ban them. To un-ban a player, you can use the command "`/pardon`".

Additionally, you have the option to ban a player's IP address. This means that even if the player attempts to access the server using a different account on the same network, they will still be unable to join. To accomplish this, you can utilize the command "`/ban-ip`". Should you wish to reverse the ban on a player's IP, you can use the command "`/pardon-ip`"

### Adding a Server Icon

Adding a server icon is an importing step in creating your server and helping players find yours in the serverlist.

1. Firstly your icon must be 64Ã—64 pixels in size, it must be named `server-icon` and in a `.PNG` format.
2. You can then stop your server via the control panel.
3. Once the server is stopped head to the **file manager**. 
4. You can then upload your `server-icon.png` and restart your server.

Congratulations! Your server now has the icon of your choosing.

### Changing your MOTD

MOTD's are the fancy text you will see on the server list, it's a great way of displaying events or other information to players.

You may use a tool like https://mctools.org/motd-creator, copy it directly to `server-properties`. If you have set it up correctly then following a restart the server will update automatically.

### Gamemode

To modify the gamemode of an individual, simply employ the command `/gamemode` followed by the desired gamemode: survival, creative, adventure, or spectator. Also, remember to substitute "player's in-game name" with the actual name of the player.

### Setting up a whitelist

A whitelist is a useful feature that allows you to specify which players are allowed to join your servers, while restricting others who are not on the whitelist from joining. To activate the whitelist, simply enter the command `/whitelist` on once your server is online. If you wish to add a player to the whitelist, use the command `/whitelist add` followed by the player's in-game name. Conversely, if you want to remove a player from the whitelist, utilize the command `/whitelist remove` followed by the player's name. Lastly, to deactivate the whitelist, enter the command `/whitelist off`.

If you wish to grant a player access to commands and operator status, you can do so by using the command `/op` followed by the player's in-game name. Conversely, if you want to remove operator status from a player, simply enter the command `/deop `followed by the player's name.

<Tip>Spigot-based servers strongly discourage the utilization of OP as it grants players access to potentially unsafe commands. Instead, employ a permissions plugin such as LuckPerms to assign the necessary permissions to your staff.</Tip>

## World Management

### Uploading your World

To accomplish this, you can compress the entirety of the world into a zip file and subsequently upload it using a specific method. It is important to ensure that the size of the compressed world file is below 100MB. In case the file exceeds this limit, it is recommended to employ SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for uploading the world.

1. To compress the world, go to the **File Manager** tab. Here, you will find the server files and folders. Locate your world folder and compress it into a `.zip` file. You can utilize programs like WinRAR or 7-zip to compress the folder. On Windows, you can also right-click, select "Send to," and choose "Compressed (zipped) folder." On Mac, right-click and choose "**Compress 'Folder'**."

2. Next, drag and drop the zip file into the file area within the Citrus Control Panel. Once the file is uploaded, click on the three dots next to it and click on "**Decompress**" to decompress the zip file. Once you have completed the decompression process, the uploaded zip file is no longer required. You can safely delete it by clicking on the three dots next to it and selecting "**Delete.**"

If your world exceeds 100MB in size, it is advisable to use SFTP to upload your world file.

If you happen to have folders labeled as `world_nether` and `world_the_end`, it is advisable to upload them aswell.

### Resetting your World

Firstly either navigate to your server's files either through SFTP or our Control panel.

<Warning>Any steps from here will result in a complete wipe of your world and all it's contents. Proceed with caution.</Warning>

Once you have taken any necessery backups, you locate the world directories within your servers files. By default they will be called world, world_nether, and world_the_end. 

Select which of the world(s) that yu wish to reset and click the three dots on the right or right click. Then click the **delete** button.

Once they have been deleted you can restart your server. If you accidently delete the wrong world you may be able to recover it from the recycle bin.

## Using Plugins

In order to use plugins on your server, you will require Spigot, CraftBukkit, Paper, or any other compatible version that allows plugin integration. 


### Installing Plugins

When installing plugins you can either use our built in plugin installer which you will find under the **Plugins** tab within the control panel or install them manually.

To install a plugin manually, simply move the `.jar` plugin file into the plugins folder, which will be automatically generated by the server upon startup if it supports plugins. Finally, restart the server for the changes to take effect.

<Info>If you're moving from a vanilla server to a Spigot one, then you won't have to reset your world. Moving from Forge/Fabric to Vanilla/Spigot can be tricky, or even impossible, because Forge/Fabric mods often alter the save itself in order to include custom blocks, items, and mobs.</Info>

## Spark

Spark is a performance profiling plugin (with limited availability for Forge and Fabric) that can display server information, such as TPS, memory, tick durations, CPU usage, and disk usage. But more importantly it can create a performance profile that can be viewed on a fully feature web interface. It does not require any configuration and is incredibly easy to install.

### Spark Profiles

The profiler function, initiated by the command `/spark profiler start`, is a highly effective diagnostic tool. It is recommended to execute the profiling during periods of server stress for optimal results. 

To maximize the report's accuracy, allow the profiler to run continuously for at least 10 minutes. Further customization can be achieved by incorporating additional parameters, with detailed instructions available in the Spark Documentation.

When ready to examine the profiler results, run the command `/spark profiler stop` and capture the generated link. Upon opening the link, you will find a user-friendly web interface with a comprehensive display of all the data.

### Timings Reports

Takin a Timings report is a critical step in diagnosing and optimizing the performance of a Minecraft server. 

To take a timings report, you can use the `/timings` command. This report provides detailed insights into how the server is utilizing its resources, enabling server admins to identify potential bottlenecks and areas for improvement.  

Once the `/timings` command is running, the server collects data for a specified period, usually recommended during times of high server activity or stress. 

After the data collection period, the `/timings` report command can be used to generate a summary of the server's performance.  

Regularly obtaining Timings reports is a best practice to ensure the smooth operation of the Minecraft server.

## Networking

### Different IPs

You might see the term **Dedicated IP** used on our platform. This means that you will be able to connect to the server on minecraft's default port `25565`. This is important because it wont't require you to insert the additional port (`123.45.67.891:25565`) when connecting to your server, whilst the default IP will require the port found in the panel for connections.

### Custom Domains

If you have purchased your own domain name then you will have the ability to change your IP for a domain like `play.domain.com` or even `domain.com`. This is popular due to it being more memorable and looking more proffesional. 

Firstly you will need to go to your DNS management, we would recommend **Cloudflare**. Then create an **A Record**.

Press Add Record and set the following credentials:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dedicated IP">
    - Type: A
    - Name: Set this to the subdomain you want to use (e.g., play, mc). If you are using a shared IP (and it requires a port), then set the subdomain to something else because we will need to use it in the SRV Record.
    - IPv4 address: Set this to your IP Address without the port.
    - TTL: Auto
    - Proxy status (if available): DNS Only
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No Dedicated IP">
    - Type: SRV
    - Name: Set this to a subdomain you want to use to connect to your server. This must be unique compared to the one you used in the A record. If you want to connect directly to the domain, set it to '@'. The name set in the A record will only be used by the SRV record and can be set to any name.
    - Service: _minecraft
    - Protocol: TCP
    - TTL: Auto
    - Priority: 0
    - Weight: 0
    - Port: Set this to your IP address's port.
    - Target: Set this to the subdomain you set in the A record earlier (in our example, we've set it to 'connect', and the domain is example.com. So, we will use 'connect.example.com').
  </Tab>  
</Tabs>

Once you have completed the necessary steps, you are ready to go! You will now be able to establish a connection with your server by utilizing the subdomain specified in the SRV record, along with your domain name (for instance, `play.example.com` in our example).

## Datapacks

Datapacks are `.zip` files that you can use to enhance your experience without installing Mods. Installing one is simple, once you have downloaded the datapack you want to head over to your File manager. Find the `world` dorectory. Within this folder, you will discover a designated directory named `/datapacks/`. 

Open this to proceed with the upload process. You can either drag and drop the desired datapack into the folder or use the **Upload** button.

## Resource Packs

To install a server-wide resource pack on your Minecraft server, follow these steps. 

1. Start by selecting a resource pack compatible with your server's Minecraft version. Access your server files, and create a folder named "resourcepacks" in the server's directory if it doesn't exist. 
2. Upload your chosen resource pack in the `.zip` format to this folder.
3. Open the "`server.properties`" file and locate the line starting with "`resource-pack=`", and add the URL or relative path to your resource pack.
4. Save the changes, restart the server, and players will automatically download and use the resource pack when connecting. 

Optionally, for more reliability in updating the resource pack, you can include the SHA1 checksum of your selected resource pack. This ensures that clients can update the pack seamlessly, even if the filename remains unchanged. 

To obtain the SHA1 checksum, execute certUtil -hashfile \path\to\file SHA1 on Windows or shasum /path/to/file on Mac or Linux. Alternatively, you can utilize emn178's online SHA1 checksum checker. Once obtained, update it to `resource-pack-sha1=` on the second-to-last line of the `server.properties` file.
