## Basic Administration

In Vanilla Minecraft, there are a set of fundamental administrative commands available for managing player access to your server. These commands can serve as warning systems or enable you to remove problematic players from your community. To execute these commands, you will need to provide the username of the player in the designated space. The first command, "`/kick`", allows you to kick a player out of the server. This will immediately remove them from the game. The second command, "`/ban`", enables you to ban a player from the server. Once banned, they will be unable to join unless you choose to un-ban them. To un-ban a player, you can use the command "`/pardon`".

Additionally, you have the option to ban a player's IP address. This means that even if the player attempts to access the server using a different account on the same network, they will still be unable to join. To accomplish this, you can utilize the command "`/ban-ip`". Should you wish to reverse the ban on a player's IP, you can use the command "`/pardon-ip`"

### Gamemode

To modify the gamemode of an individual, simply employ the command `/gamemode` followed by the desired gamemode: survival, creative, adventure, or spectator. Also, remember to substitute "player's in-game name" with the actual name of the player.

### Whitelisting

A whitelist is a useful feature that allows you to specify which players are allowed to join your servers, while restricting others who are not on the whitelist from joining. To activate the whitelist, simply enter the command `/whitelist` on once your server is online. If you wish to add a player to the whitelist, use the command `/whitelist add` followed by the player's in-game name. Conversely, if you want to remove a player from the whitelist, utilize the command `/whitelist remove` followed by the player's name. Lastly, to deactivate the whitelist, enter the command `/whitelist off`.

If you wish to grant a player access to commands and operator status, you can do so by using the command `/op` followed by the player's in-game name. Conversely, if you want to remove operator status from a player, simply enter the command `/deop `followed by the player's name.

<Tip>Spigot-based servers strongly discourage the utilization of OP as it grants players access to potentially unsafe commands. Instead, employ a permissions plugin such as LuckPerms to assign the necessary permissions to your staff.</Tip>

## Uploading your World

To accomplish this, you can compress the entirety of the world into a zip file and subsequently upload it using a specific method. It is important to ensure that the size of the compressed world file is below 100MB. In case the file exceeds this limit, it is recommended to employ SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for uploading the world.

1. To compress the world, go to the **File Manager** tab. Here, you will find the server files and folders. Locate your world folder and compress it into a `.zip` file. You can utilize programs like WinRAR or 7-zip to compress the folder. On Windows, you can also right-click, select "Send to," and choose "Compressed (zipped) folder." On Mac, right-click and choose "**Compress 'Folder'**."

2. Next, drag and drop the zip file into the file area within the Citrus Control Panel. Once the file is uploaded, click on the three dots next to it and click on "**Decompress**" to decompress the zip file. Once you have completed the decompression process, the uploaded zip file is no longer required. You can safely delete it by clicking on the three dots next to it and selecting "**Delete.**"

If your world exceeds 100MB in size, it is advisable to use SFTP to upload your world file.

If you happen to have folders labeled as `world_nether` and `world_the_end`, it is advisable to upload them aswell.

## Using Plugins

In order to use plugins on your server, you will require Spigot, CraftBukkit, Paper, or any other compatible version that allows plugin integration. 

To incorporate Spigot or its forks, you can make use of the **Versions** tab within the panel. Alternatively, you can manually upload the jar file and configure the Server Jar File Startup Parameter to match the name of the jar file. To install a plugin, simply move the `.jar` plugin file into the plugins folder, which will be automatically generated by the server upon startup if it supports plugins. Finally, restart the server for the changes to take effect.

<Info>If you're moving from a vanilla server to a Spigot one, then you won't have to reset your world. Moving from Forge/Fabric to Vanilla/Spigot can be tricky, or even impossible, because Forge/Fabric mods often alter the save itself in order to include custom blocks, items, and mobs.</Info>

### Our Plugin Recommendations

Below is our list of plugins that can be beneficial for any type of server. While installing these plugins is not mandatory, it is highly recommended to do so. It is important to understand their functionality and how to utilize them effectively:

1. **CoreProtect** is a plugin that serves the purpose of recovering damaged blocks and recording data to prevent griefing. It is advisable to install and configure CoreProtect on your server.
2. **DriveBackupV2** is another plugin that offers the convenience of remotely backing up your server data. Installing this plugin can ensure that your data is securely stored.
3. **LuckPerms** is widely regarded as the go-to permissions plugin for most servers. By utilizing LuckPerms, you can restrict the permissions to use plugins only to specific players, thereby enhancing the security of your server.
4. **BungeeGuard** is an intra-network authorization plugin that prevents unauthorized players from accessing your backend servers if they have not joined through your BungeeCord proxy. Installing BungeeGuard can further safeguard your server from potential threats.

## Networking

### Different IPs

You might see the term **Dedicated IP** used on our platform. Tmeans that you will be able to connect to the server on minecraft's default port `25565`. This is important because it wont't require you to insert the additional port (`123.45.67.891:25565`) when connecting to your server, whilst the default IP will require the port found in the panel for connections.

### Custom Domains

If you have purchased your own domain name then you will have the ability to change your IP for a domain like `play.domain.com` or even `domain.com`. This is popular due to it being more memorable and looking more proffesional. 

Firstly you will need to go to your DNS management, we would recommend **Cloudflare**. Then create an **A Record**.

Press Add Record and set the following credentials:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dedicated IP">
    - Type: A
    - Name: Set this to the subdomain you want to use (e.g., play, mc). If you are using a shared IP (and it requires a port), then set the subdomain to something else because we will need to use it in the SRV Record.
    - IPv4 address: Set this to your IP Address without the port.
    - TTL: Auto
    - Proxy status (if available): DNS Only
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No Dedicated IP">
    - Type: SRV
    - Name: Set this to a subdomain you want to use to connect to your server. This must be unique compared to the one you used in the A record. If you want to connect directly to the domain, set it to '@'. The name set in the A record will only be used by the SRV record and can be set to any name.
    - Service: _minecraft
    - Protocol: TCP
    - TTL: Auto
    - Priority: 0
    - Weight: 0
    - Port: Set this to your IP address's port.
    - Target: Set this to the subdomain you set in the A record earlier (in our example, we've set it to 'connect', and the domain is example.com. So, we will use 'connect.example.com').
  </Tab>  
</Tabs>

Once you have completed the necessary steps, you are ready to go! You will now be able to establish a connection with your server by utilizing the subdomain specified in the SRV record, along with your domain name (for instance, `play.example.com` in our example).

## Datapacks

When adding a datapack into your server, you must first navigate to the **File Manager** tab and access the `world` folder. Within this folder, you will discover a designated directory named datapacks. Open this directory to proceed with the upload process. You can either drag and drop the desired datapack into the folder or use the `Upload` button located on the left side.

Some datapacks, such as ones from VanillaTweaks, `.zip` files might have "unzip me" in their name. This is a note from the creator that you need to unzip the file before using it in the world.
